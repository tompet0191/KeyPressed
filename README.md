# KeyPressed
Simple debugging tool that returns keystrokes sent to the console

## How to use
Run the program and it opens a console window. Any keystroke sent from the keyboard or a device acting like a keyboard (e.g. a scanner, card reader, etc) to the console will be displayed
with its corresponding ASCII code and which keys were pressed to generate that keystroke (along with any modifier keys).
